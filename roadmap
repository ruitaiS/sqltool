2/23:
Menu navigation doesn't work after switching to dialog. Probably should have kept it as-is and functional instead of trying to trying to overhaul everything at once. Made this mistake before :/

Committed to it now I guess. Bite off more than you can chew and then chew it.

Added a template which seems to work ok. Working on incorporating the bits of the main logic back into it.

I notice that I'm substantially less motivated to work on these projects than I am for my day job, and I want to change that. I know I can work harder. I know I have the time for it. It's really all the same; the distinction is arbitrary. Progress is progress. If anything, I should be more motivated because it's for me and nobody else.

2/13:
schema selection

2/11:
Credential Encoding/decoding with gpg
Environment Selection
Schema listing

---Todos / Bugs:

Change dialogue box background color

table selection using multiselect

dump file selection from local directory

automatic filename generation - timestamp_schema_tables.sql

load / dump operation parameter confirm screen prior to execute

manage gtid parameters on mysql dump so that it loads properly

run from config

Migrate to dialogue for all menu navigations
Manage "clear" use so that only relevant information is displayed


---

dump should dump the schema + the selected tables into the generated filename

load should load selected dump file into the selected schema
	tables determined by dump file itself
